# 7-DOF-Vehicle-Model
Vibration Analysis of the 7-DOF Vehicle Model

- Derived and verified equations of motion for the 7-DOF model by Newton and Lagrangian methods
- Solved the equations using ode45 and measured the systemâ€™s response, including accelerations of the objects, displacements of the tires relative to the body, and movements of roll, pitch, and bounce.
